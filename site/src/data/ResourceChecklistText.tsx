        <b>Make sure you have your assignment and know when and where you are supposed to show up on Election Day! </b>
        Make sure you’re ready to wake up on time and arrive at your assigned polling location early.
        If you’re late, that could mean polling locations don’t open on time, so be sure you set an extra alarm!
        Make sure you’ve got everything you need for the day - whether that’s extra snacks, phone charger, comfortable shoes - or all of the above!

        <b>Have your local elections office contact info saved in your phone in case you need them. </b>
        This will help you be ready to report problems at your polling location through the proper channels and call for help if you have issues with voting machines or anything else.

        It may not be legal to take photos in your polling location (check first),
        and you’ll be pretty busy working, so think about posting a photo before your shift starts or in the weekend leading up to Election Day!
