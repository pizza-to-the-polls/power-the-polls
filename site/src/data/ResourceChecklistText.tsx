        Make sure you’re ready to wake up on time and arrive at your assigned polling location early.
        If you’re late, that could mean polling locations don’t open on time, so be sure you set an extra alarm!
        Make sure you’ve got everything you need for the day - whether that’s extra snacks, phone charger, comfortable
        shoes - or all of the above!

        <b>Have your local elections office contact info saved in your phone in case you need them. </b>

        help if you have issues with voting machines or anything else.

        It may not be legal to take photos in your polling location (check first),
        and you’ll be pretty busy working, so think about posting a photo before your shift starts or in the weekend
        leading up to Election Day!
        Use the hashtag #PowerThePolls and tag @powerthepolls!
