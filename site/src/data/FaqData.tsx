            {
                question: "What are the requirements for being a poll worker?",
                answer: () => <p>
                    Qualifications vary by jurisdictions. Most states require poll workers to be registered to vote in
                    the state or their local jurisdiction. Some local elections offices have student poll worker
                    programs for younger people who aren’t yet eligible to vote but would like to play an important part
                    of the democratic process
                </p>,
            },
            {
                question: "Can I be a poll worker in a state I don’t live in/am not registered in?",
                answer: () => <p>
                    Individuals are generally only allowed to serve in the state where they reside though
                    there may be exceptions to this in select jurisdictions.
                </p>,
            },
            {
                question: "I’m not a U.S. citizen / I’m a permanent resident. Can I serve as a poll worker?",
                answer: () => <p>
                    Most states require that poll workers are U.S. citizens. The best place to find guidance is with
                    your local administrator.
                </p>,
            },
            {
                question: "I’m under 18. Can I still help?",
                answer: () => <p>
                    Many states allow individuals under 18 to be poll workers, but each state has its own requirements,
                    and this can vary between different cities and counties. Some states also have additional
                    requirements for students like permission slips, a certain GPA, etc. The best place to find this
                    information is by reaching out to your local election administrator.
                </p>,
            },
            {
                question: "Do I have to work the full day, or can I sign up for a shift?",
                answer: () => <div>
                    <p>
                        Some jurisdictions allow workers to sign up for shifts, while others require you to work full
                        days. Hours also often vary for early voting work versus Election Day. If you’re concerned about
                        the hours, you should submit your application and let your election officials know about your
                        availability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If your jurisdiction requires a full day of work and you can’t make those hours but still want
                        to help, think about recruiting other people you know to be a poll worker and can serve for the
                        full time needed.

        questions: [
            {
                question: "What do poll workers do?",
                answer: () => <p>
                    There are many kinds of jobs for poll workers to do, including helping voters check in, managing
                    voter lines, troubleshooting equipment, and providing directions and assistance. Poll workers may
                    also assist with various office duties.
                </p>,
            },
            {
                question: "Is a poll worker the same as a poll watcher?",
                answer: () => <p>
                    No, these are different roles. Poll workers work for election administrators to help administer the
                    election. They do things like check in voters, fix voting machines, and troubleshoot any other
                    issues at polling sites. Poll watchers, which are sometimes also known as poll observers and poll
                    monitors, are volunteers or staff from a political party or campaign that are certified to observe
                    and monitor election administration. In most states, only political parties, candidates and ballot
                    issue committees can appoint poll watchers. Organizations and civic groups can also appoint poll
                    watchers in some states.
                </p>,
            },
            {
                question: "Do poll workers need training?",
                answer: () => <p>
                    Local jurisdictions often host mandatory trainings, and provide poll workers with all the necessary
                    information and skills they need prior to Election Day.
                </p>,
            },
            {
                question: "Does it matter if I’m a Republican, Democrat, or Independent?",
                answer: () => <p>
                    Poll working is usually a non-partisan activity and your party affiliation does not matter, but in
                    some states poll workers are matched to locations in pairs based on their party registration. This
                    is sometimes done to ensure party balance among poll workers at every polling location. Applications
                    in some jurisdictions may ask you for party registration information for this purpose.

                question: "Once I submit my name and email here on Power The Polls, is my application complete?",
                answer: () => <p>
                    No! We are here to connect you directly to your local elections office, where you need to fill out
                    an application and/or provide information so your local elections administrator can reach out to
                    you.

                question: "Can you mail me an application?",

                    Unfortunately, Power the Polls can’t mail you an application -- but we can connect you with the
                    people who can. You should <stencil-route-link url="/search">reach out to your local
                    administrators</stencil-route-link> for information on how to proceed.

                question: "What do I do after I complete my application?",
                answer: () => <p>
                    Be sure to be on the lookout for any communication from your local election administrators! Be
                    proactive in reaching out to your local elections office to follow up on the status of your
                    application and make sure you are signed up for any training or mandatory information sessions. The
                    earlier you can reach out to your elections office the better. The closer you get to the upcoming
                    elections (including any primaries) the busier those offices so be proactive early on.
                </p>,
            },
            {
                question: "Do poll workers need training?",
                answer: () => <p>
                    Local jurisdictions will often have mandatory trainings or optional information sessions, and
                    provide poll workers with all the necessary information and skills they need prior to Election Day.
                </p>,
            },
            {
                question: "When will the training start?",
                answer: () => <div>
                    <p>
                        If you've already applied, you can check in to see if your local administrator has posted new
                        training information. In some places, there are online trainings you can start immediately,
                        though many may not be scheduled till closer to the election.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If there is no information about trainings online, reach out to your election administrator
                        directly to ask when trainings are and how to schedule yourself to attend.
                    </p>

                question: "I applied, but I haven’t heard back from my local city or county!",
                answer: () => <p>
                    While there is a great need for poll workers right now, many election administrators do not reach
                    out to poll worker applicants until closer to Election Day. Be persistent and proactive to find
                    information since many of these offices are understaffed - that’s why they need your help as a poll
                    worker!

                question: "What’s the deadline to apply/for recruitment?",
                answer: () => <div>
                    <p>
                        Most election administrators accept applications on a rolling basis, so we do not have a set
                        deadline nationwide or even state-by-state. However, getting applications in as early as
                        possible is important to help administrators in their planning.

                answer: () => <p>
                    We completely understand that plans change. If you can no longer be a poll worker, one of the most
                    important things you can do is recruit people to replace you this year to help keep polling
                    locations open!

        questions: [
            {
                question: "Are poll workers paid?",
                answer: () => <p>
                    Local jurisdictions will often pay poll workers a stipend for their participation. In most cases,
                    you will be paid with a check for a day’s worth of work. In some cases, poll working may be
                    voluntary and not paid. You can find out more about pay in your jurisdiction by <stencil-route-link
                    url="/search">reaching out directly to the local elections office.</stencil-route-link>
                </p>,

                question: "I’m concerned about my safety. What precautions are being taken to protect poll workers?",
                answer: () => <p>
                    Power the Polls is working with local organizations and partners to help election officials provide
                    PPE. If you have specific concerns about what PPE will be provided in your jurisdiction, please
                    reach out to your local officials for more information.

                question: "I have a disability. What accommodations are being provided?",
                answer: () => <p>
                    These vary state to state, so the best place to find information is by contacting your local
                    elections administrator directly.

                question: "I don’t want to be paid to be a poll worker.",
                answer: () => <p>
                    If you are not interested in being paid, you can ask your administrator about waiving your wages. If
                    that is not possible, you can choose to donate it to a charity.

                answer: () => <p>
                    Poll workers usually cast their votes early or by mail, but some cast their votes on Election Day.
                    Certain jurisdictions may require poll workers to vote early or via absentee ballot. Your local
                    elections official can provide details about how poll workers cast their ballots.
