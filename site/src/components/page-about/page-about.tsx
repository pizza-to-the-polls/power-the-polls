                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>
                    Power the Polls was launched in June 2020 by a coalition of businesses and nonprofits seeking to
                    recruit a new wave of poll workers ahead of the 2020 election. America was in the midst of a
                    nationwide poll worker shortage, and the consequences had already been felt in primary elections
                    with reduced polling locations, long lines, and voters waiting to cast their ballot for several
                    hours. Historically, most poll workers are over the age of 60, and in the era of uncertainty caused
                    by the coronavirus, fewer were signing up for the job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Power the Polls had an original goal of recruiting 250,000 new prospective poll workers. In less
                    than 100 days, Power the Polls harnessed the energy of individuals interested in ensuring a fair,
                    safe and secure election, and was able to recruit over 700,000 prospective poll workers across the
                    United States. Consequently, the shortages we saw during the 2020 primaries were limited in the
                    general election: little to no poll worker shortages were reported during statesâ€™ early voting
                    period and on Tuesday, November 3, 2020.
