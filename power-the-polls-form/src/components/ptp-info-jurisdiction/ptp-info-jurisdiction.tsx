                                Requirements vary and are determined by cities and towns
                                in Michigan, but all poll workers must be a registered
                                Michigan voter or 16 or 17 years old residing in
                                Michigan. While you can vote with a felony record, you
                                cannot serve as a poll worker in Michigan if you have a
                                felony or any infraction related to voting.
                            </p>

                                    Serving as a poll worker is a paid position with a
                                    flat daily rate. Many cities are also providing
                                    hazard pay for poll workers who serve during the 2020
                                    election.

                                    While hours vary, both by city and by position
                                    worked, most poll workers should expect to work long
                                    days, beginning before polls open at 7am and
                                    concluding after polls close at 8pm.
